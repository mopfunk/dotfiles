# Dotfiles

## Purpose of this Repo

This repo is for storing and sharing my BSPWM, Openbox, and general Linux configs/rice.

## Ricing Philosophy

I aim to have a clean, usable, and pleasant workflow in my daily computing. My rice is based on being efficient while maintaining style.

I find that BSPWM is my favorite tiling window manager at the moment, and that is what this rice is aimed at.

The color schemes, polybar, and general configs will work with most - if not all - setups!
